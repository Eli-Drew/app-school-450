"Very detailed beginning although almost too pack of a slide of the Task Progress 
Very nice update of the GUI and the application overall and it is looking and sounding great!
Overall a very detailed presentation which was nice although sometimes it might have looked overfilled on slides but that is just a minor opinion
Sprint updates were very detailed again and included multiple aspects like each task, incomplete tasks, as well as percentage complete and a burndown chart

"2. explained their new dataset, confusion matrix. Video of program in action was nice, two commands and their output. Front end changes looked really good.
3. described their QA efforts well. 
4. good sprint update!
5. could tell the group was very excited about their project, was a nice touch. hit everything required"
The demo covered features in a way that was very informative and well conveyed. A visual breakdown of user stories and tasks after the progress on them was demonstrated would have been better in my mind however. Individual contributions were not clearly conveyed. The overall progress was well covered however.
"Really good UI, however I would change the text colors for ""angry"", ""fearful"", etc. to be easily readable. This guide may be helpful: http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/."
"love the animations
can users specify what voice? like male or female? accents?
"
nice job!
"The project overview was very helpful in reminding us the objective of your project. Demonstrated user stories and task progress with good explanation of the confusion matrix. The UI is very impressive and the colors used with the animated graphics makes it very appealing. Displayed visual pie chart, project velocity, burn-down chart, and percentage completed. Excited to see the outcome of your project. "
Live demo made your already great presentations better. Project looks great!
I liked how you displayed the matrices and you had a great explanation of how it worked. The front end improvements look good. You did a great job with the presentation!!!
I really liked live demo
"2. The title of your slide made it very easy to know what you're talking about. The video demo and explanation were very helpful. 
3. The QA and testing plans were broken down into subsections which helped explain how your plan is constructed and what you are looking for. Also liked how you specified your critical tests. 
4. Sprint updates were bullet pointed, which made it easy to keep track of your progress and how the software has changed during the sprint. 
5. Presentation was very organized and each member contributed to important slides. Overall it was a good presentation and would have been very effective if/when presented to a customer. "
Great demo and presentation.
Accuracy is very impressive I am assuming it was because of all the steps you did to filter all your audio. Very impressive.
I simply found no flaws in this last demo. Great job everyone!
good job
Good detail regarding the implementation of the ML model. Good demo of the application. The animated emojis were a nice touch that make the UI look great. 
"The video demo did a fine job of briefly demonstrating the application's main function, though the live demo at the end provided a more comprehensive view of the program's side features."
"Good demo!
