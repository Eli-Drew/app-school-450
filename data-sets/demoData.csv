Comments and feedback to the group.
Great presentation! Very clear explanations and details.
Really thorough and organized
Team 5 did an amazing job presenting the project and made it easier to understand the overall concept of it.
"For task 3, if I could give 90% (-10% for not having the pie chart and the burndown chart) I would. Their efforts is absolutely above the 80% mark, but 5* does not mean it is perfect. Other than that, the work they have done is superb, considering it is just the end of the first spring. "
I really like your project. thank you
well organized. team members seem to work well together. trello board seemed to fit team well
Looks like you're making really good progress so far. 
"The team has good communications. The plans for the project is well planned out.
The burn down chart was implemented incorrectly"
Intro/requirements are really good. User story accomplishments and product demo could have tied together a little bit better.
Everyone was well spoken
The team all seemed to be very organized and professional in presenting their first sprint as well as being dedicated to recording 250 audio files.
"I liked how you explained your reasoning for your nonfunctional requirements and constraints, as it showed why you set the performance thresholds and programming restrictions the way that you did."
Professional and well done organization. Tasks seemed to be done pretty effciently
Your presentation was very informative and it seems like your group is making good progress on your project
"Your group has solid planning and documentation, which would be great for tracking progress/changes. The only feedback I would give would be to look in advance with tasks (such as time limitation with the microphone) so that it doesn't burn up as much of your sprint time. "
The burndown chart did not look how I thought that it should. You all seemed very knowledgeable about you project. 
Great Job! Where did you find the time?
None
Very well organized for the number of individuals in this group. 
Very good job
"Great job so far, keep it up!"
Presentation was slightly slopy and had small lack of professionalism. Requirements were slightly poorly explained
Presentation was slightly confusing could be clearer and better organized
Example slide had a lot of code that was hard to read. Maybe just a chart showing what happens would be better for next time. 
"Requirements and Sprint burndown was clear.
Example demo was not as organized."
"No burn down chart was available 
Code snippet wasn't easy to read/follow along 
Output is confusing 
Pie Chart wasn't clear/concise - doesn't show percentages or what the pie chart is of"
No burn-down chart. Functional and nonfunctional requirements were very thoroughly described. Nice visual of the mutation aspect of the genetic algorithm. Code provided was confusing and difficult to follow.
"good job on presentation, some of slides seemed confusing though, "
be better in the next spints
"I do not think they need to show the complete requirements with all their description in the slides. Maybe my eyes is just bad, but I could not see the slides with those small words. The description should be said by the team members, or put in the slide's notes. 
I don't quite get the velocity from the slides, nor did I see any burn-down chart.
Great effort considering they are missing one person for this demo."
"The overall presentation was good, however the PowerPoint was a little confusing to follow. "
"Presentation seems to have leaned too much on showcasing the code/algorithm for project. Not enough information of which tasks is being work with or which task is done. 
Missing burn down chart"
A darker style for the slides would make it much easier see and read. The pure white background was hard to look at. The pie chart was largely redundant since it had no units or labels and seemed to just show everyone at the same percentage other than one.
Good spread of information discussed by the members.
It's been a race to get up and going in this course. Don't fret this first go around. I'm excited to see your next presentation!
"No burn-down chart was provided, and the team contribution pie chart lacked percentage labels."
They did accomplish things to put in as velocity
Definitely spread the work load out more.
"Team struggled with presentation, but had good content for their slides.
Had good FRs and NFRs, constraints were well-documented.
Did well in detailing the ""hows"" and not only the ""whats"" of the project.
"
"You missed a few things such as the burn down chart, and your presentations seemed like you had not practiced. "
The team seems to have a decent understanding of how they will implement the project. The tasks completed were brushed over quickly where I almost missed them so I gave a 4 star rating. The burndown was missing which caused me to give a 4 star rating on number 3.
"Good organization and structure of presentation. 
"
" Overall great job and nice job thinking about the rates and how different mics could result in different sound. However, the not including a sound dampener for incoming sound that wasn't needed is something I think should be implemented."
"I am excited to see the front end of this project, I feel like a project like this is very dependent on how intuitive and enjoyable the user interface is. I think it is pretty ambitious to go with a genetic algorithm for this project, I think that is a really good approach to this problem. This was originally the group I was interested in being a part of just because I feel like you guys can make it a lot of fun. I liked that you gave sample data and output but it was not always clear what that data really represented. Good luck with your next demo!"
"The FR/NFR/Constraint section was highly detailed and I learned the most about the project from that section. I personally think the scheduling algorithm section was confusing to me and lacked information, but I understand that the teammate who led this part was absent. The Sprint-1 update section didn't have a burndown chart and the pie chart was hard to understand as there was not any units or supporting information. "
"It looks like half of the work completed this sprint was split between two members of the group. Ideally every member should have equal percentages in effort. Although Noah was the scrum master for Sprint 1, I recommend the team all having a good understanding of the project and technology.  I would recommend adding percentages to the Team Contribution's chart so you can see the data, not just the breakdown. 

4/5 for overall project management: missing burndown chart. Mixed up velocity and story points. Weren't many slides on team's trello board.
4/5 demonstration of completed tasks: did this presentation show what user story they worked on? There was an overview of the Trello board, but I don't remember seeing individual stories correlated to this sprint. 
4/5 professional presentation and team dedication: the team contribution chart showed that 2 team members did 25% each. The other 3 students did about 15% each (these were estimations given the pie chart was missing any numerical percentages).

I really how this group added a ppt slide on the soft scheduling constraints and explaining why they are important. "
"Your project seems very interesting, and your presentation was clear and concise. I look forward to see how your team goes about how you extracting and storing C++ functions to your database. I am also interested to see how your team goes about designing descriptors for the C++ functions."
Each member in the team seems involved. Overall project management is well written and easy to understand. After presentation was able to understand what the project is trying to achieve.
"Great diagram for the product functionalities, though I hope the icons are a little bit bigger. 
I hope the requirements and constraint have more clear format, instead of the wall of text.
Great presentation on the PMP.
They make good progress on the project, although sometimes it is hard for me to make sense of what is on the slide because of the small texts.
"
"You're burndown chart was really good and complete. The overall progress pie chart was very clear and easy to understand as well. 
Can research be a user story?"
Great description of the project. I really liked organization and way how tasks were distributed across team members.
I like how they used a pie chart to make an estimate of how far they are on their project.
I gave a 4 star rating for project overview because I am a little unclear as to what the project will do. The burndown looked good as well as the pie chart showing overall completion. 
"Project overview was super clear, functional and non-functional requirements were straightforward and easy to understand. 
Project management was thorough, solid explanation of work completed and work expected. 
Your subsystem/function descriptor slides helped explain how your software will work, which I found helpful. "
Good presentation overall and great progress so far. Seemed unprepared to answer questions so I'd prepare better for next time.
"I think this looks very promising. When I first read the description of this project I was quite lost as to what the final deliverable would be but you guys broke it down very well. You all very clearly communicated the project and what you have done along with what you still need to get done. I am excited to see what comes of this project and I think this could be incredibly helpful if applied in the corporate setting. Great demo, I am excited to see it in action next time!"
This is an intimidating project. Though your approach is in it's initial stages it looks promising. 
"Parsing through a database is an interesting way to tackle the problem that I didn't initially think about. The total hours pie chart was a good visual. Communication seemed to be good, each team member was knowledgeable about every instance of the project."
"Has a clear flowchart to shows the core functionality of a project. 
Has a clear end goal for the project (served as a web app)

The overall presentation has a clear structure, its easy to read. Has explanation for the completed task (show code) and explanations for the algorithm. 
"
"The beginning of the demo portion was very good, but I was quickly lost in the next slide or two."
"Team looked and dressed professional.
Project overview was good, but read straight from the slide.
Some issues with formatting on the Functional Requirements slide (see bullet #3). Furthermore, it wasn't clear if these were CORE functional/non-functional requirements or an exhaustive list.
Trello organization was impressive and well-labeled; did not mention velocity.
Some team members seemed a bit more familiar with the project than others based on how much each member answered questions and presented.
Overall, a great presentation, aside from beginner-related problems.

Questions asked/wanted to ask:
(ask to go back to NFR, ask about 24hrs)
(ask about why they chose to use both Jira and Trello)
(Did you assign user stories based on team member interest or did you take into account stakeholder priority)
(On the terms extraction, the program seems to extract terms based on splitting on the spaces between words--is this portable to something like C++ code, where these rules aren't necessarily followed?)
"
"I actually like that they are using Jira for their tasks management.
For the user stories, I think they should have more user stories focusing on the actual development than the researches."
"Fantastic burn down chart, keep up the great work and stay ahead. Excellent presentation."
"The illustration on the starting slides showing the architecture/design of the project gave a lot of insight into the project; I haven't seen any other group do this. After seeing the NFRs, FRs, and constraints, I felt like I had a good grasp on the project. 

The Sprint-1 task update slide was very strong and the burndown chart was correct. I wish there would have been more detailed about what ""percentage completed"" meant. Is that completion based on code or data from Trello?

There was a lot evidence to show that the group has been researching into the problem. From the word parsing demonstration to the concept document, this section was very impressive. 
"
"Project overview: Good job with core functional and non functional requirements, and constraints. There seems to be some unknowns/TBD for project specifics?  I do recommend determining the weights of words and acceptance of your algorithms. 

Overall project management process: Good job with including screenshots of individual stories, the tasks assigned

Demonstration of completed tasks: I like the pie chart along with the burndown chart. I do recommend showing the ppt slide of the completed tasks before you show the burndown chart. Because it gives the audience an idea of what all the team took on, and then the progress. Graphs are well put together. I would recommend adding the prototypes you created this sprint so you have concrete examples of things you completed (ie: code), not just metrics.

Professional presentation: Good job. The presentation as a whole was put together well. I like the concept document/design slide."
"Impressive amount of work done so far. 
Could have explained the primary goal of the project better, like more on what the already existing software does
"
"I liked the breakdown of tasks/user stories in Trello with labels and what area each task would correspond to.
The format for presentation was cluttered and seemed to also be lacking organization within the project as the team just worked on different aspects.
I thought the idea of moving some things over to Jira is a good thought and could help organize but may later lead to confusion as it clutters the work environment."
Research can be included as tasks in user stories instead of two different user stories since there is a high probability that every user story will contain some sort of research.. We did not get a glance of the details or tasks included on the two research stories presented but research is not what is being delivered. Overall very well organized and everyone appeared to be very dedicated/interested to this project. 
Group seems to work and communicate well. I have a clear vision of what the project is wanting to turn out to be. Presentation was organized. 
Great use of clean and simple layout of the data pertaining to a professor. I think the UI to submit a file could use a little work as it seems a bit basic. 
"Great use of use-case diagram.
Other than the lack of the pie chart, I have no complaint for the PMP part.
They got a GUI working. That's great so far assuming they have the core functionalities working."
"The introduction to your project was a bit confusing and hard to follow
Didn't go into much depth of the project
Loved the graphics and explanations of the visuals 
"
"While it didn't bother me personally, one of these criteria is listed as ""Professional presentation"" and the opening segment and some of the more comedic comments felt more like a fun sales pitch, which technically wasn't professional.
The requirements section adequately conveyed the scope of the project.
I really liked the mockup ups.
The burn-down/completion percentage stuff could have probably benefitted from a more condensed and digestible representation."
Good presentation however could have done more to show off your code so far as well as demonstrate the amount of work  completed so far
"If I was a stakeholder, I may prefer that your presentation used more formal fonts. While you didn't complete many formal tasks for this presentation it is clear that you have thought about your project quite a bit. "
"I really like how the dashboard looks as of right now. I know the program is still early in development but the UI while you are typing the text is not very engaging and does not seem all that engaging to the end-user, before you build it I would look to existing designs. I can see that a lot of work went into the design of the dashboard and I think that is going to look really good. I think this project looks like a lot of fun and I am excited to see where it goes from here. Really good job! "
"The Burndown chart seems to miss a linear line of an ideal line to get the tasks done.
The plan of this project is very in-depth and you can clearly see what is the expected output"
GUI visualizations were well organized and looked good. There wasn't anything to really show for completed tasks though. The burndown chart wasn't done correctly.
"Although the FRs/NFRs/Constraints were detailed, I still struggled to understand the format of the CSV files (phrases separated by commas? words? Paragraphs?).
Good job specifically defining how Github is used on the team.
Only briefly explained current tasks/User stories.
Did not show entire sprint's worth of work.
Liked how they presented on what the final GUI would look like. However, seems like a bit more effort was done here than other areas of the demo.
Team was whispering to one another during presentation, which was disrespectful to the current speaking member.
Wasn't entirely clear on the scope of the project (how .csv files look, how that file would be parsed, how this information would be used/its value, etc.)
"
"Good touch going into detail about the minute details of the project and not just a ""this project does this!"" type of approach, as well as including a use case diagram for the program.
As well as I thought the idea of finding a website that would aid in a mock up of the program was also a nice touch and brought the project together nicely with the visual aid.
Good point brought up from someone about the format of input files or .csv but could have gone into more about how the data will be inputted and handled if different formatting, wrong file type, etc."
Background colors and font used in presentation could be a little more professional since the white and mint can seem overwhelming and the font is not ideal for a product demo. Very good explanation of constraints and reasons behind them. Visuals helped paint the final product in my mind so I now know what the ending goal of your project is intended to look like.
"Gave helpful background information that applies to the project. Use-case helped with overall concept of software. 
Project overview was covered by a use-case, and the functional and non-functional requirements were easy to understand. 
Clear explanation of trello, burn down chart, etc.
The analysis tool was a highlight to me, I thought it was cool/a great way to represent data. "
"Explained thematic but not semantic
Very good presentation, interesting
"
"The introduction to the problem was unclear to me; The presenter during the use case diagram demonstration didn't go through all of the steps. The requirements did cover what the output of the program would look like, but what is actually encapsulated in these .csv files? 

There was not much elaboration on what got done during this sprint; Only the velocity/burndown chart was shown. What exact tasks got done?

The concept documents and tentative UI graphics were very strong and these alone did help me fill some of the missing gaps from the beginning of the presentation. I just wish there was more elaboration on what thematic analysis is; There was only a very brief description of that in the beginning of the presentation. "
You guys did not have very many hours that were put into the project according to the burndown. It seemed as though you put in more hours into making the charts and the designs than you listed. 
"Reading notecards without having text on slides makes it hard to follow. I was still a little confused (after the overview) what the project even was. Project management and overall process was broken down in a very organized manner. Amazing gui design, very thorough! Presentation: there seemed to be a lack of communication amongst group members (had to keep going back and forth through the slides)."
"Project overview: Good job with organization of NFR's, FR's and constraints! 

Overall project management process: Had burn down chart, but used the wrong data, need a negative slope

Demonstration of completed tasks: I like the mock GUI.

Professional presentation: Good job!"
"The opening introduction felt somewhat jokey, and it was mildly jarring to switch back to the Trello board slide at the end of the presentation to discuss the task distribution when it wasn't covered before. I did like the mockup of the GUI, however."
Your work progress is quite slow
"Liked your display format, very imagery focused 
Seemed very organized 
Liked the thoroughness of you core functional, non-functional requirements and constraints"
"I like that you included QA, packaging and bug fixing stories."
"Overall I think you guys had a really good presentation, especially considering how many people you have in your group. You guys all seem knowledgeable and have a pretty cool demo this early on. Really great job and I am excited to see where you guys take this project!"
Burndown chart was done correctly. Pie chart was easy to understand. The video was a great visual and proof of work done. 
"Overview, requirements, and constraints were very concise and easy to understand. Presentation was fairly well-organized, but there were times that it appeared no one knew who was supposed to present the slide. Demo was short and left me with several questions."
"Project scope - could use a little clarification. Obviously it is a face-analysis software, but didn't really explain the point of developing this software. 
It seemed like the group either left out or skipped over some requirements, and didn't go into great depth with the ones covered. Constraints were super clear, explained thoroughly and easy to understand. 
Project management process flow chart didn't include much relevant information to project management, it was more about how your software will work. Could have spent more time on trello, but good information about sprint 1
Didn't provide much information about user stories that were covered, no slides about the completed stories. 
Presentation was very colorful and might have had too many visual aids, but it wasn't anything that took away from the presentation "
The team gave a good explanation on what the project will do. The burndown looked nice. The video showing how the peoples faces are process with the dots being landmarks helped to understand how they will implement the project. I don't recall seeing much on the completed tasks causing me to not give 5 stars on that rating.
"Very good job, nothing was left to my imagination and was covered very well. Also, very well presented."
"I understood the main idea behind behind the project, but still has some lingering questions afterwards.
The charts used in the burn down were very digestible.
While the presentation of completed tasks was very nice, I didn't feel like the what the tasks that were completed were explained in a way that I had a complete understanding of what was done."
"The working demo was really neat, and very eye opening on how this project will be implemented. The PowerPoint had lots of unique representations of data and ideas. "
Your support application seems to be quite effective.
"I understood what this application needs to do, but it did feel like information was presented a little out of order for some reason."
"Overall not bad, good point bringing up the issue of having to have a landmark stored that is static for object comparison. How to store the landmark data of eye/arm/body part length etc? The non functional requirements need to be worked on.
How is data being detected - every 5 frames or upon start or? Also, did not mention accuracy besides 50% which personally I wouldn't believe is sufficient as that would not provide a positive ID if only 52% for example."
The presentation of the core functionalities and non-functional requirements was hard to follow as both slides had completely different themes of displaying the information. Organization seems to be lacking as there seems to be some confusion between which slides are to be presented by each team member. Aside from Trello there was also no solid method of communication used between team members. Very interesting project and looking forward to seeing the final product.
"Great demo video!
Could have explained their requirements more"
"Some of the NFR/FRs were confusing and some NFRs seemed like they were FRs and vice versa. Besides that, the presentation was very well put together; The burndown charts and information on velocity were detailed. The introduction of the problem was well explained. 

The demonstration was very interesting to watch, and I like how you guys explained the current challenges such as factoring distance of the individuals from the camera. This gave a really interesting perspective on the problem at hand. 

My only concern was that 2 team members did not speak or answer any questions throughout the entire presentation; The team did not seem cohesive. 
"
"A lot of the requirements seemed to bleed into the project scope/overview.

Took an interesting/unique approach to overall project management process.

Best burndown chart of the day, and good looking pie chart.

Good looking demo, liked how they mentioned some of the roadblocks with depth/distance.

The entire team did not get to contribute equally contribute to the presentation it seemed. Some spoke only a little bit, others did not speak at all, and some seemed to drown out the rest.

Trello board seemed a bit bare and it seems the team may have some organization issues down the line -- note: star rating changed after live-viewing of Trello board. Still a bit messy but seems much more insightful than the first.


"
"The PowerPoint was very colorful and made information very clear. The presentation was done very well, but there was some slides where you were just reading off the board instead of knowing the material."
They could have gone more in details about the functionalities and non-functionalities because for someone who has no knowledge about the project it is hard to understand.
Burnout chart wrongly done. Small lack of content done and mentioning that user story was done only to put something to presentation does give me mix feeling about how much team members care about developing product.
"Project overview: I recommend stating the identification related to the NFR, FR, and Constraints (ie: NFR 1.1, FR. 1)
Overall project management: Good
Demonstration of completed tasks: Missing burndown chart?
Professional presentation: Overall, the presentation's aesthetic was nice. Content wise, I suggest adding technical details. Great demo of the video though."
I liked how you provided your plan for what order you plan on completing your user stories. I also liked that you provided a demonstration of the basic facial recognition software.
Comments and feedback to the group supporting your ratings above.
Describtion of diagrams was coherent
"Radio checks can be used on the is TA radio button so both can't be clicked. No velocity for this sprint, hence 3 stars."
"The project overview felt kind of short, I feel that with a sprint being 2 weeks long...the project overview should still remain simple yet detailed in case people don't remember much of the project.
Very descriptive sequence and state diagrams! 
The GUIs look very nice! Great job having this done in only the 2nd sprint!
Individual contributions weren't listed nor the percentage of the project that had been completed
"
"I personally think they could give a more detailed overview of the project.
Team give clear and detailed diagrams. 
Clear explanation of the process of the project. Good burndown chart. No pie chart or velocity chart."
"The overview given was concise and a good reminder, however I didn't see motivation for the project. The team did a great job with the system models. They showed what they completed as well as a good looking burndown chart. They were missing a pie chart showing the overall completion."
Good presentation of diagrams. Good amount of work done this sprint even though no stories were finished. Detailed answers to questions asked during the presentation.
"Good job explaining diagrams, very well organized presentation however team 1 could have further clarified and went into more detail when explaining the code of their project"
Did not fully understand the overview and motivation. Great use of diagrams. Overall very good presentation.
"Your first to use case diagrams felt like they left a lot to be desired. I got very little information from them on top of the formatting for the text being very poor. All around, I was left with the impression that all of your use cases could have been merged into one and still would have deserved a little more fleshing out.
Overall, too much time was spent on diagrams and too little time was spent on actual results in my opinion. A briefer overview of the diagrams and a deeper dive on everything that came after would probably have been a substantially more interesting presentation.
The GUI example was, by contrast to the diagrams, much more interesting and looked good.
The burndown section was very well paced and efficiently presented. ""Individual contributions"" did not seem to be covered at all. I have no idea who did what. There was also no graph representing total project completion. 
"
Overview was very short. Very nice sequence diagram! First state diagram had no end node. Demo mockups and GUIs looked great.
thank you
"Really good presentation. Good flow and well-organized. Intro at the very beginning felt a little brief, so did the sprint updates. The overview seemed somewhat redundant, but it was very well explained."
During the beginning of your presentation you seems to be rambling on and not very familiar. Once you got to the code and tasks completed you seemed a lot more interested and confident and your explanations were very well done.
"Team seemed relatively knowledgeable of their information, but sometimes read directly from the slides
GUI looked nice, thinking about edge cases
Demoed code, which was a plus and seemed knowledgeable of what the code was doing.
Scrum master had a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the team.
Team didn't outline individual contributions.

"
Great progress. GUI looks great. 
"The input and output scenes were very good well put together.

"
"The use case diagrams felt overly simplistic with only two use cases per diagram, but the state and sequence diagrams were well detailed. The UI demo with associated code was also nice, and demonstrated progress even if the user story was not fully completed."
"- The presenter's descriptions of the use cases were helpful to better understand the project. I do wish that the use case names had more detail; Some of them were just a single word, which made it hard to conceptualize what the use case really was. 

- I gave a 5 for the system models because the state and sequence diagrams were very clean and intuitive, and the group's descriptions of these illustrations made it easy to compartmentalize all the different functions of the project, especially where the genetic algorithm fits into the project. They definitely made up for the use cases in my opinion. 

- UI is very deliberate. Very straightforward and seems easy to use. This is really well designed! I like how you guys show the TA and professor views side by side.

- Some missing agile information based on the rubric, but I still felt like I learned a lot about where you guys are at in the project.  

- Massive improvement from the last presentation. You guys should be proud. "
"I liked seeing the UI a lot, I know its a little text heavy due to the nature of your project but I think the approach you guys are taking is really good. I like the code sample you guys showed."
"The burn down chart looked better this sprint.
Curious if you have something working and showable at this point"
"Clear diagram and explanations of diagrams. Has clear demos for forms to input information.

Have a demo for what have been completed in this sprint

"
good work on the initial display interface for schedules
"Good overview and motivation.
Good explanation on the diagrams, but they could have include the other diagrams.
Good updates on the user stories and tasks. Great process!
They include the charts, but I did not expected it to be before the demo :))
(Please choose a more contrast text color next time)"
Well done
Could have shown other diagrams during software overview. Could have gone more in depth when explaining project motivation
"You guys have a firm grasp on the problem it seems and the group seems in sync with the solution. 
I like the last slide that has answering of common questions such as tockenization."
Great work. We have been uploading our videos to youtube then inserting them in the slides. Google slides has native support for this and makes it very easy. This may make it easier to avoid video issues in the future.
Would have liked to see the state and sequence diagrams. Sprint updates and velocity seemed to jump around. The specific story updates were well done.
"The project overview was short, but I liked the motivation provided for your project.
Code snippets and completed user story demos were very thorough. 
Overview of software system model not provided/shown
Individual contributions were not given 
"
thank you
"Good overview of project. Demo was well-explained. Slides seemed to go back and forth between demo and US summary, workflow could be better. Updates on user stories was very detailed. Where are the software system models?"
"2. Clear explanations of overview and motivation. I like how you separated the two topics 
3. The use case diagram was comprehensive and helpful, but a different diagram would've gone a long way to help understand the flow of your software (ie. sequence or state diagram(s))
4. Extensive explanation of user stories and the progress completed. Demo was comprehensive, overall gave a clear idea of your tasks, the progress made, and what that looks like in your software
5. Sprint update had all the parts required, burn down and pie charts were simple and easy to read
Overall the presentation was very organized, but I felt as though a lot of time was spent covering the user stories on your trello board and not so much on the progress you made to the tasks. "
"overall code looks well organized, missing most of diagrams but otherwise all looks good"
"- descriptive overview/motivation
- also potentially over descriptive User Story information as it seems 4-5 slides were all screenshots of Trello or descriptions of the same User Stories within Trello
- good to shift to GUI based models to display versus only Trello screenshots
- demo of completed User Stories was more so describing the 2 completed User Stories instead of a demo
- less text or Trello screenshots since it seemed nearly every slide was a Trello screenshot or User Story screenshot or a description of the same User Story using bullet points
- maybe a benefit to demo what a response would be then dive into the code after as well (although issue happened with video loading which is totally understandable)
- Overall a good presentation although I would recommend presenting less Trello screenshots or descriptions and walking through the project first and then presenting the code so that we have an idea of whats happening first then how it is done versus learning how something we dont know happens then learning what is happening after."
"While the refresher on the project overview and motivation was good, I believe it would be better to talk about it in a way that felt natural rather than being read from a script. 
The  user story breakdown was very thorough. It was done in a way that I felt very confidently that I understood what was intended to be completed and what was actually completed and it didn't feel like it lasted too long.
Some of the code presented seemed either largely pointless or didn't convey much of interest. I'd personally rather not see code unless it's substantial. That being said, it's very early on still, so for this sprint it doesn't make sense to penalize for it. I would expect more from here on out though."
"Only include 1 diagram
Clear demonstrations of what tasks is done 
Has demonstrations of the code and the code output"
Good overview of the general project. Great answers to questions during the Q&A portion.
I really liked how you guys showed so much code and the output of your project. I think using python to make UI can be very challenging but I think you guys have done well so far.
"Only one bad review - the team only included a use case diagram and should have included sequence and state diagrams.

Presentation-wise, the team always seems to be well prepared.

Included great project progress update.

Burndown chart looked good, could have labeled x and y axes.

Good user story breakdowns, and despite another team talking very loudly in the back, maintained good pace.

I liked that they had comparisons of their actual GUI to their wireframes. However, it may look bad having a really ambitious wireframe and then an implementation that stylistically/functionally doesn't represent the wireframe.

The group did a great job divvying up the presentation responsibilities.

Mindful of edge cases, which is good.

Showed code. Could use more in-code documentation for maintainability.

Showed tasks, which were delegated - this covered the base of task delegation presentation.

Once Sam asked, they explained Tokenizing input very well.

The team seemed to have a well-rounded knowledge of their program.

Stanford Core NLP from Stanford"
I liked how you showed the a lot of the code. I liked the overview of each user story. The use case diagram was very well done but I was expecting more diagrams.
"2. Had an overview slide that explained motivation
3. Only showed use case diagram?
4. Good preview of GUI! code snapshots
5. Included alot about their trello and user story updates
6. Focused heavily on code examples and not enough system model demonstrations
"
"Strongest agile/progress update of any group so far - Good burndown chart, completion statistics, and screenshots of your trello board. Really nice to see you guys knocked out two users stories over the 2nd sprint!!

- Good display of UI progress and updates on how you guys plan on parsing input for your project. Presenting code can be tough to pull off, but you guys explained it well enough for someone who is not working on the project to understand what the code does for the system. 

- It would've been nice to see more than one use case diagram."
Use case diagrams were very detailed. I liked how you went over each use case. The section that had code for the modeling could use a simpler explanation. Could use some more diagrams since that was a big part of this sprint.
I would have liked to hear more about your search algorithm
"entire project is well organized, progress was well updated from last sprint demo."
It might be best to change the pie chart away from percentage. As its is confusing on how much is left.
"Brief overview, but include all I need to know.
Great process! Good explanation over burndown chart and pie chart.
Clear diagrams and good explanation over them too. PROFESSIONAL MANNER. I would give 6 stars if I could, based on the confident of the guy alone.
Good explanation over codes."
"Velocity chart estimated vs actually very close. The algorithm to generate word relevancy is really neat, even if values weren't high due to small sample size."
Great job on making a lot of progress in a early sprint. Good presentation with clear and concise examples and explanations.
Very well organized and detailed presentation. 
Great describtion of the work done during a spring
"I like this project a lot, I am excited to see the UI from the web interface when you guys get that built out. I could see this tool being very useful for a company once they get functions added in."
"- Very specific with individual contributions, as names were listed beside each completed task. 

- The code examples were really interesting to see how you guys are parsing code; It was a neat throwback to some of the things a lot of us learned in CSC 333. Be careful showing too many screenshots of code; I think you guys should add more processing examples/results beside your code examples. 

- The class diagrams were a great way to go above and beyond.

"
"Has a clear quick overview
Include all diagrams with clear explanations. Speaker has clear understanding of models
Include trello update, burn down
Has a clear goal (web architecture)"
"The organization seemed a little broken up as far as going from one topic to another. From the demos, it wasn't clear to me exactly what had been accomplished."
"- Great introduction and task delegation slides.
- Great explanation for troughs in velocity line
- State diagrams look nice.
- Despite technical difficulties, the team did a great job continuing their presentation
- Included sprint deliverables, which was a nice touch.
- Mindful of edge cases (example: ignoring curly braces in comments/strings etc.)
- Included a class diagram, which is nice.
- Good in-code documentation in some areas
- The team had better overall participation during this presentation, which hinted at good delegation of tasks
- Great job justifying shortcomings
- Sprint 3 deliverables - nice. Gave us something to expect and keeps the team accountable for the next demo"
"2. Opening slide explaining motivation of project. working for private company
3. sequence diagram, class diagram
4. included examples from their application
5. Included details of each completed user story, burndown chart, % completed
6. hard to understand at times, terminology"
"- good to list who completed what beside the User Story instead of just having contributions on another slide
- hard to read State Diagram as text beside it restricts the size of the diagram when it should be bigger
- the US-01 Logic Walkthrough was nearly unreadable due to the size of the code against the black screen so maybe just changing the settings from dark to light for the screenshot 
- the FDG: Code (2 slides) were still hard to read with the dark background and dark screenshots as well as the need to zoom in to show detail versus just throwing in as many code descriptions as possible
- The US-07 Initial Codebase Example code example was unreadable besides for maybe a first row or 
- good addition of adding in the next sprint deliverables
Overall a good descriptive PPT although possibly zooming into code examples and maximizing them would help readability while also creating better understanding about the process/project as well"
More of a description about the project at the beginning would be helpful.
"The state diagram could have been simpler for easy understanding.
"
"Clearly presented overview of project,  motivation and system model"
The overview of the project was a little too brief and still not sure I quite understood the goal of the application from the overview. The software system models looked good and were nicely explained. They had lots of code to display showing the progress they have made.
"2. Project overview slide had a lot of information on it but only spent about 10 seconds on the slide. Overview gave a general idea of what the project was about, but if you had all that information why just skip over it?  
3. State Diagram was a little difficult to read (might have been better to split it up a little), but state diagram and sequence diagram were well thought out/explained and gave a good idea of how the software works
4. Images, explanation, and code snippets flowed together and gave a good idea of how the code was constructed and what it looks like in your software
5. Burndown chart was easy to understand, pie chart was easy to read, 
Overall my biggest critique was that you used a lot large images that contained a lot of info/small text. Consider breaking up the images and 'zooming in' so that those in the back of the class can actually read what it says. Other than the image/font sizing the presentation was very organized and it was easy to follow along with the work you have done and how your software as a whole is coming along. "
"Project overview and motivation was good. Fantastic use of diagrams! The presentation was pretty good, but the beginning was way too fast to keep up with. Try to keep a general tempo throughout the entire presentation."
"I liked your detailed overview of each user story, including code. The use case diagram was well detailed, though the chained <extend> functionalities suggest that each optional function must be performed in order to use the next."
This seems like the hardest project. Kudos for taking it on. Would be great to hear more from a wide range of your team members.
"I still have to commend you guys for taking on one of the most challenging projects this semester, even with the libraries you guys are using I can't say this is easy to get right. It looks good so far and you guys seem dedicated to the project."
Presentation seemed to have some uneeded info. Velocity is still very low. 
"- Good overview; I like how you guys talked about the potential business cases of your software. No other groups, if I remember correctly, gave any detail like that. 

- State diagram was the best work out of all the UML diagrams you showed. There are a lot of moving parts in this project and it gave a lot of detail how you guys stored data on each tracked individual. The scanned drawing of the sequence diagram was quite hard to read. 

- EXCELLENT demo of the landmarks extraction. Really cool to see how the features of individuals in the webcam are represented as data. 

- Loved the slide talking about what you learned by stepping back from changes made in your 1st and 2nd sprint. 

- Major improvement from last presentation. It was great to see more people in the group was involved in this presentation. "
"I like the use of code and the explanation of what libraries you are using and why you chose to use them.  I liked how you had the velocity comparison to Sprint 1.
I feel like it was missing how far along you are in the total project.
The explanation of the software system models were a little hard to follow."
you guys have a very good software support but I think you are in need of writing a software for yourself instead of advertising for another software so you should code more and show what they run.
"Your use case diagrams looked very good from a format perspective and I actually really liked the ""dark mode"" aesthetic personally.
Not every person in a group will be able to communicate as well as others. While it's important to give everyone a chance to show their contributions, it may be better have the people that are more fluent in English take the brunt of the technical demonstration. Many things made it harder to follow the information simply because of how it was presented from the speakers.
The explanation of why you swapped technologies was helpful, but could have been handled a little better. Presenting your original attempt as ""outdated"" and phrasing it as not mattering made me wonder why it was included until an explanation was given (which happened a whole slide later).
A larger section covering individual contributions felt needed."
"I liked the detailed use case models. The hand-drawn picture of the sequence diagram didn't mesh well with the rest of the UML diagrams presented, and was somewhat difficult to read. "
"What does TorchReID do differently than MediaPipe that led you to choose it?

- This team spoke in the back of the room for a large majority of the first 2 presentations and some of the third -- this was very disrespectful and displayed a lack of professionalism (3 stars)
- Second and third use case diagrams are drawn incorrectly (box around use cases missing)
- Although outdated, MediaPipe landmark extraction looked good. 
-TorchReID output looked great and was impressive"
"Good project overview and motivation example.
The overview of the software system model was not very detailed or explained thoroughly. 
Loved the demo and projects outputs that were shown. You guys were very thorough and detailed, very easy to follow along. The code was very small and kind of hard to interpret. "
"Good organization. However, what user story 4 did was confusing until the Q&A portion."
"Overview was thorough and well-described. There were several use case diagrams displayed, without an overview of how all of it was connected; this makes it hard to follow. Demo was amazing! Great to see a view of the camera with nodes on a human body. Code was too exhaustive for the sake of the demo; we cannot really see what is happening. Organization was greatly improved from last time. Sprint update made it seem like there wasn't a lot of progress this sprint."
"Uses case diagrams looked more like state diagrams. I know it's hard to get code to look good in slides, but the code on the pre-trained model looked like tiny dots."
Clear idea of project overview and motivation. Decent models. 
"2. Project overview was clearly defined and explained, but the motivation seemed a little generic/vague 
3. Included multiple use case, which helped show how different parts of your system will function/flow. The color scheme for the use case diagrams could have been better thought out (small white text is hard to read). Sequence and state diagrams were also somewhat difficult to read
4. Review of sprint progress related to the user stories and the work you have done, which clearly showed how much work you accomplished during this sprint. Had the some photos that demonstrated work completed but no code snippets or anything else. 
5.  Velocity chart was informational, and the burndown chart and pie chart were good. 
The organization of your presentation was good, but there were multiple issues with images/diagrams including size and color"
#NAME?
"2. included use cases of software, what it intends to do
3. included all UML diagrams
4. included pre-trained model code, had to redo alot this sprint so not much demo
5. includes burndown, task completions"
Overview and motivation was good. System model and demo of completed tasks was not very clear what was actually accomplished.
The team had a good overview reminding what the project was. The software system models were very detailed and specific. They also showed a good amount of the progress made through the sprint. 
The sequence diagram will probably need more work because it was hard to follow along.
great powerpoint. project overview and updates were easily understandable. group seemed fully involved. user stories and task organized great
"Well organized presentation. Clear diagrams, and concise explanation. Good overview of project and system model. You all have an interesting project and I really liked your audio processing demo, good job!"
"Good overview.
Very detailed description with the models.
Great process. Great explanation over the demo.
Good burndown chart. Lacks pie chart and velocity chart.
Good plan for the next sprint."
"You guys gave a very detailed overview of your software system model. 
Loved the video provided that demonstrated the GUI demo.
One thing I would change in your project would be the colors chosen to describe the emotion/the text used. It is difficult to read...
"
"The demonstration of the GUI was very good. However, I think the recording was sort of long for a presentation. I don't think we need a demonstration of log files and where they are. The video took the place of a lot of your presentation. the second video was good. It just demonstrated and the person explained what it did. "
The project overview was very well explained. The software system models were also detailed. The progress made shown in the videos were impressive and the updates of the overall sprint all seemed to be there.
Great presentation.
A little more info about your overall project would've been helpful. Great job!
System models were very thorough and easy to understand. Amazing demo!! Very well organized presentation.
I really liked the new demo and how it was described 
Adding a visual pie chart would have help to see the progress of the team.
Great demonstration. The amount of work you all have gotten done is incredible.
"The introduction to the project was done very well. You also did a fantastic job presenting the diagrams while using that to explain your project. The first video demo was very informative and showed your project's GUI very well.
The part with the updates and charts seems like it was a little rushed through. "
"The initial overview was well-detailed without dragging on, and I liked the refresher on what you had completed during the previous sprint. The first video demo did an excellent job of demonstrating how your program functions, as well as what additional files are generated in context of its operation. The second video was similarly helpful in showing how the denoiser function performs, which would be difficult to fully appreciate using a static image."
"Of all of the different project overview/motivation sections, yours struck me as the most well presented. It wasn't a copy/pasted textbook reading but more of a conversational reminder which I really liked.
Your use case diagram was one of the few presented that wasn't overly segmented. Your state diagram was slightly too small to read comfortably. Same with your sequence diagram.
The video demo of the GUI was very informative and thorough. However, it felt like it dragged on a bit and like the information could have been presented more efficiently. Finding a balance between showing all of the small things that you've accomplished and still moving along at an engaging pace would bring that up from a 4/5 to a 5/5.
The other video demo was used much better as it demonstrated a the point that it was intended to in a very concise and visually helpful way.
There didn't seem to be a large section comparing this sprint to last sprint, or maybe it was presented in a way that didn't stick with me if it was there. Either way, it didn't stand out as remarkable."
"Fantastic overview and motivation, very well received and understood.  Perfect use of diagrams; presented very well. The Audio Processing Chain slide and video seemed unnecessary as the previous video seemed to explain these system features."
"Has clear diagrams and explanations for the diagram
Include completed task, burn down and plans for next sprint
Has a video demonstration of how the program works"
"- Good balance to include the example of the app as well as text beside it properly spaced and readable as well
- Recording and Processing state diagrams may have been better on different slides to enhance readability to better understand the diagram
- Diagrams became slowly larger and harder to read due to including text describing them next to them so it hurt the ability to read and understand 
- Great job with the video uploaded to YouTube and a successful demo
- Good to detect other microphones as the user may switch or get different ones so that was an intuitive UX feature
- User Story slide was beyond overfilled with text to where breaking it up into 2-3 slides versus 1 would make it easier to understand and less cluttered
- Good slide w/ the Next Steps and the plan moving forward

- Any restrictions on who can see those files or could another user also use the application on the same computer and be able to see all of their logged recordings?

- Overall very descriptive PPT as well as a great job with the video walkthroughs of different parts of the application

"
thank you
"2. I really enjoyed the image included on this slide. The project overview was comprehensive/detailed, which helped catch us up on where you are in the software and its purpose. However, there wasn't really any motivation mentioned for this software
3. Use case image was a readable size but not too big, and the descriptions on that slide helped add to the explanation. Similar comments for the state diagram. Sequence diagram was a bit harder to read due to size, but the flow of the diagram itself made sense and was easy to follow
4. Demo was a bit loud, but the video was very immersive. Presents the result to the GUI and is color coordinated, which was cool to see working. The demo was very comprehensive, detailed all the work for different parts of the system. 
5. User stories had too much text, spent more time reading the screen than comprehending what was actually on it. The burndown chart was good, and the velocity was good too. Included project completion but no pie chart. 
Overall this was a very good presentation! The video was a highlight, but the diagrams and explanations were also well thought out and very informational. "
Great demo and presentation. Great answers to questions asked.
"2. informative reminder of their project
3. Included all required models, a little hard to read but overall well done
4. included a nice video of everything their program does so far, spectrogram was a nice touch to explain further
5. burndown, completed stories, what they plan to do next were all included

Very good job"
